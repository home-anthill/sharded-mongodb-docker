# Example MongoDB Sharded Cluster Deployment In Docker Containers

A project requiring a single command to build and run a MongoDB Sharded Cluster in a local workstation with each MongoDB component (_Mongod_, _Mongos_) running in a separate Docker container. Uses a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) project to launch the [sharded MongoDB cluster](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/sharding/) containerised deployment.

Each element in the deployment topology (9 _Mongod_ processes for the 2 shard replica sets and the _configdb_ replica set + 2 _Mongos_ processes) runs in its own Docker container and all the containers are visible to each other on the same _internal_ network. Once running, the MongoDB cluster is accessible directly from your workstation, via localhost forwarded ports 27107 & 27108 which connect to each of the two Mongos processes respectively.

The first time you execute the command to build and run the containers, it take a couple of minutes to download all the base Docker images. When executed the second and subsequent times, the containers will all come up in around 5 seconds.

## Prerequisites
* Your workstation is running a recent version of Linux, Windows or Mac OS X
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) is already installed on your workstation
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is already installed on your workstation
* [MongoDB Shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/install/) is already installed on your workstation to you to issue commands to the running database cluster from your workstation (alternatively use [MongoDB Compass](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/current/install/) graphical tool to connect to the cluster)

## Build, Run & Connect
1. Launch a command line terminal in the base _sharded-mongodb-docker_ folder and execute the following command to build and start all the containers in the Docker Compose project:

```
sudo docker-compose up --build -d
```

2. Connect to the running MongoDB cluster from the MongoDB Shell (the shell will attempt to connect to the first of the two Mongos endpoints):

```
mongosh --port 27017
```

```
sh.status()
```

_Note_: Use port 27018 instead, above, if you want to connect to the second Mongos endpoint.

## Tips

* To show all the running docker containers for this Docker Compose project, run:

```
sudo docker-compose ps
```

* To show the container logs for one of the Mongos routers, run:

```
sudo docker-compose logs mongos-router0
```

* To execute a terminal session directly in one of the Mongos containers and then execute the Mongo Shell directly accessing the local Mongos process, run:

```
sudo docker-compose exec mongos-router0 /bin/bash
```

```
mongo
```

* To execute a terminal session directly in one of the Mongod containers and then view the Mongod process' logs, run:

```
sudo docker-compose exec shard0-replica0 /bin/bash
```

```
cat /data/db/mongod.log
```

* To shutdown and remove all the Docker Compose project's running containers (ready for you to rebuild and run again), run:

```
sudo docker-compose down
```
